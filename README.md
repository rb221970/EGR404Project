## [Crafting VALORANT Strategies with AI.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/raymondbrown/404final)

### Description 
An AI-powered tool that generates custom team based strategies in the free-to-play video game known as VALORANT that are both map and agent specific and can adapt to the desired playstyle. The community that surrounds VALORANT is both lively and extremely competitive, yet there are little to no tools that provide such functionality other than generic guides from the internet (usually YouTube). While it is a niche idea, it is something highly valuable to this community that requires little knowledge and/or effort to use. 

### Resources
Riot Games API (Riot Developer Portal) for player stats and agent data, LLMs for strategy generation, YouTube breakdowns of professional strategies for my own comparison, and custom user feedback at the individual and team level to evaluate the success of AI generated strategies. 

### Deliverables
At the start of this project, I planned to show demonstrations of this tool in real time as well as my gathered user experiences. The rough timeline was as follows:
1.	Gathering successful strategies from my resources (YouTube, Reddit, [VALOPLANT](https://valoplant.gg/]))
2.	Making a prototype
3.	Testing with agents from known successful strategies to test for similarities, differences, innovation, and ability to adjust and/or adapt 
4.	Reaching out to users to test for functionality, correctness
5.	Adjusting the prototype as needed during these findings
6.	Reaching out to users again to adapt the provided strategies
7.	Evaluating their successes and/or struggles, shortcomings, etc.
8.	Refine and repeat until sufficient
9.	Final presentation

### Relevant Definitions
1. [Current list of VALORANT agents](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/agents/)
2. [Current list of VALORANT maps](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/maps/)
3. **Side**: the role of a team in a VALORANT match. Can only be attacking or defending.
4. **Attack**: the team that is either planting the spike, eliminating all of the defenders, or both. 
5. **Defense**: the team that is preventing the spike from being planted, or diffusing the spike before it detonates.
6. **Site**: A, B, and sometimes C. Refers to a specific location on a map where the spike can be planted.
7. **Economy Type**: Refers to the overall funds of a team indicating the type of artillery and abilities they can purchase.
8. **Team Composition**: The five agents that make up a team.
9. **Playstyle**: The style of the round that is usually, but not always dependent on the type of agents or economy type.
10. **Round Goal**: In respect to the outcome of the round, better understood as "How do we want to win?" or "What impact can we make this round?" (a common obstacle when economy is low). Round goal is also typically dependent on agents and economy. 
11. **Other**: The model is likely to respond using a variety of game specific language that range from agent abilities, map locations (both of which can be referenced in points 1 and 2), or other terms that relate to in-game agent positioning, player to player communication, agent rotations, and more. While impossible to capture every single last one of those terms, a more in-depth dictionary can be referenced [here](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/red-bull-campus-clutch-valorant-terms-slang-dictionary)
