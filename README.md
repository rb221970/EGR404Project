## Crafting VALORANT Tactics with AI. 

### Description 
This will be an AI-powered tool that generates custom team based strategies in the free-to-play video game known as VALORANT that are both map and agent specific and can adapt to playstyle. The community that surrounds VALORANT is lively and extremely competitive, and there are little to no tools that provide such functionality other than generic guides from the internet (usually YouTube). While it is a niche idea, it is something highly valuable to this community that requires little knowledge and/or effort to use. 

### Resources
Riot Games API (Riot Developer Portal) for player stats and agent data, LLMs for strategy generation, and YouTube breakdowns of professional strategies for my own comparison. I will also gather custom user feedback at the individual and team level to evaluate the success of generated strategies. 

### Deliverables
At the end of the project, I plan to show demonstrations of this tool in real time. I also plan to demonstrate my gathered user experiences and the differences in their performance. A rough timeline will be:
1.	Gathering successful strategies from my resources (YouTube, Reddit, VALOPLANT [https://valoplant.gg/])
2.	Making a prototype
3.	Testing with agents from known successful strategies to test for similarities, differences, innovation, and ability to adjust and/or adapt 
4.	Reaching out to users to test for functionality, correctness
5.	Adjusting the prototype as needed during these findings
6.	Reaching out to users again to adapt the provided strategies
7.	Evaluating their successes and/or struggles, shortcomings, etc.
8.	Refine and repeat until sufficient
9.	Final presentation
